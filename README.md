Wi-Fi Password Penetration Testing (WEP/WPA/WPA2)


Three main parts:
1. Network Basics.
2. Cracking WEP encryption (using 3 methods).
3. Cracking WPA encryption (using 4 methods).

There are three main encryption types:
1. WEP: Very easy to crack.
2. WPA: More challenging than WEP.
3. WPA2: Similar to WPA but uses a stronger encryption
algorithm.
